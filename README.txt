Storage=Local
I choose the local option for this project. Make command can be used to build the project.
Invocation can be done as follows:
> compfs [file]
> compfs < [file]
> compfs

the final call will wait for standard input.
Output will be the taget file name that is produced, in the format of [file].asm
If standard input was used then target file will kb.asm.
